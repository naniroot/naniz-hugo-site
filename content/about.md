My name is Narayana Ravikumar, people call me _Nani_. I've been professionally deploying to production for over five years. I am currently coding at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and have previously worked at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Commvault Systems](https://www.commvault.com/). This blog is where I share my thoughts, opinions and mild insomnia.

Now, [Would you kindly](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Would_You_Kindly) take a look around and reach out on my socials or __hello__ [at] __naniz__ [dot] __co__
